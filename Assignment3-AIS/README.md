# Natural Computing - Assignment 3
## Artificial Immune Systems - Anomaly Detection using Negative Selection Algorithms
#### Solutions team 25: Chihab Amghane, Max Driessen, Jordy Naus

This folder contains our code for the Artificial Immune Systems assignment of the Natural Computing course.
+ The notebooks contain our implementations for exercises 1 and 2.
+ The `outputs` folder contains the outputs of the Negative Selection algorithm for exercise 2; these are provided because recomputing all of them takes over an hour.
+ The `negative-selection` folder is not included: in order to run our code, this folder should be included at the same level as this README file. Note that our implementation of exercise 2 writes some additional files in this folder while preprocessing the data.
