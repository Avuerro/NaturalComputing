# Natural Computing - Weight Agnostic Neural Networks
#### Group 25: Chihab Amghane, Max Driessen, Jordy Naus

## Description

This repo contains all the code used for the project part of the Natural Computing course at the Radboud University (NWI-IMC042-2020).
The project is an exploratory study in creating Weight Agnostic Neural Networks (WANNs), and is mostly inspired by [this work done by Google](https://weightagnostic.github.io).
In total, three algorithms have been implemented and compared with Google's WANN implementation as baseline.
On top of that, these implementations have been extended to a more complex classification task, namely Fashion-MNIST.

## Structure

The repo contains 9 notebooks, and one Python source code file.
First, both the notebook named ```preprocessing.ipynb``` and the source file ```preprocessing.py``` have been used to create the preprocessing pipeline.
Both work the same, although the notebook contains visuals to show the preprocessing pipeline.
