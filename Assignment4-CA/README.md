This folder contains our code for the Cellular Automata assignment of the Natural Computing course. All folders include `artistoo.js` and `fpsmeter.min.js`, as these files are required to run the simulation.
+ The `Simulation Random` folder contains all code required to run the "Random" simulation, where cells move randomly.
+ The `Simulation Target` folder contains all code required to run the "Target" simulation, where cells move from left to right.
